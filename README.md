# RangeCollection
Implements a 'Range Collection' class. A pair of integers define a range, for example: [1, 5). This range includes integers: 1, 2, 3, and 4. A range collection is an aggregate of these ranges: [1, 5), [10, 11), [100, 201)

Three basic functions of this class
a) Adds a range to the existing ranges
b) Removes a range of numbers from the existing ranges
c) Prints the existing ranges
